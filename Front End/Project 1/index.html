      The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated
      <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Junglefowljungle">fowl species</a>,
      with attributes of wild species such as the grey and the Ceylon jungle
      fowl[1] that are originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a
      term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel.
      A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called
      a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.

      Originally raised for cockfighting during the 500 B.C time frame in China
      according to estimations in the study of the sub-haplogroup C1,[2] or for
      special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic
      period (4th–2nd centuries BC).[3][4] Humans now keep chickens primarily as
      a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.

      Chickens are omnivores.[29] In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to
      search for seeds, insects, and even animals as large as lizards, small
      snakes,[30] or sometimes young mice.[31] The average chicken may live for
      5–10 years, depending on the breed.[32] The world's oldest known chicken
      lived 16 years according to Guinness World Records.[33] Anatomy of a
      chicken. Diagram of a chicken skull. Eggs from different breeds Roosters
      can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage of long
      flowing tails and shiny, pointed feathers on their necks ('hackles') and
      backs ('saddle'), which are typically of brighter, bolder colours than
      those of females of the same breed. However, in some breeds, such as the
      Sebright chicken, the rooster has only slightly pointed neck feathers, the
      same colour as the hen's. The identification can be made by looking at the
      comb, or eventually from the development of spurs on the male's legs (in a
      few breeds and in certain hybrids, the male and female chicks may be
      differentiated by colour). Adult chickens have a fleshy crest on their
      heads called a comb, or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin either side
      under their beaks called wattles. Collectively, these and other fleshy
      protuberances on the head and throat are called caruncles. Both the adult
      male and female have wattles and combs, but in most breeds these are more
      prominent in males. A 'muff' or 'beard' is a mutation found in several
      chicken breeds which causes extra feathering under the chicken's face,
      giving the appearance of a beard.[34] Domestic chickens are not capable of
      long-distance flight, although lighter chickens are generally capable of
      flying for short distances, such as over fences or into trees (where they
      would naturally roost). Chickens may occasionally fly briefly to explore
      their surroundings, but generally do so only to flee perceived danger.
