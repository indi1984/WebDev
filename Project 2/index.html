                The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated
                <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Junglefowljungle"
                    >fowl species</a
                >, with attributes of wild species such as the grey and the
                Ceylon jungle fowl<sup>[1]</sup> that are originally from
                Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male
                bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that
                has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a
                hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.

                Originally raised for cockfighting during the 500 B.C time frame
                in China according to estimations in the study of the
                sub-haplogroup C1,[2] or for special ceremonies, chickens were
                not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd
                centuries BC).[3][4] Humans now keep chickens primarily as a
                source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.

                Chickens are omnivores.[29] In the wild, they often scratch at
                the soil to search for seeds, insects, and even animals as large
                as lizards, small snakes,[30] or sometimes young mice.[31] The
                average chicken may live for 5–10 years, depending on the
                breed.[32] The world's oldest known chicken lived 16 years
                according to Guinness World Records.[33] Anatomy of a chicken.
